# AG Photography etc

## Description
This is my family photography website. It is made using Create Next App, bootstrap, and react. It is very similar to the one I made through Showit, but this one is made more by hand rather than drag and drop. The site itself is to showcase my photography and my coding.

## Future Road Map
Changing all/most images to use Image/next.js so that they load better and figuring out the priority property, expecially since this site is photo heavy.
Implementing a blog.
Updating images as they come
