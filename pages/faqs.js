                            question="HOW MANY IMAGES WILL I RECEIVE?"
                            answer="The amount of images is dependent on the package. After base edits and culling you will have 7 days to choose your faves. You can totally purchase more than those included, just pick them out, I'll send the invoice, and get to it!" />

                            answer="I use a Sony a7ii. I do like to use my 50mm f/1.8 lens for the most part but do have a close and far zoomy lens, and a 35mm." />

                            answer="I have been taking pictures for about 6 years now but was mostly focused on pretty landscapes and doggies. Last year I decided to really invest in my education to photograph more people!" />

                            answer="I don't go crazy far, and do charge a travel fee for anything over 20 miles. It is just $1 for every mile over 40 miles, starting at $20. It basically ends up being $1 per mile, but it doesn't start until it hits the 40 mile mark from 95307 (to & back)" />

                            question="CAN WE MEET YOU BEFORE BOOKING?"
                            answer="It depends on the session. For the most part, I am mainly a portrait photographer so these may be short sessions and adding an in person meeting would be unnecessary, but I am so down for a phone call/text or zoom meeting!" />

                            question="WHAT SHOULD WE WEAR FOR PHOTOS?"
                            answer="I have a style guide I will be sending you! It has a lot of information about what looks better for my style of photography and what could be avoided and all that good stuff!" />

                            answer="Nope! I do not give out RAW files as they are not a true representation of my work. If I were to sell these, they would be more for commercial use due to copyright laws and that is at a much higher rate than edited jpegs. <br/><br/> I would also hope that you chose me for the style I can provide you and not just because of my prices." />

                            question="CAN YOU PHOTOSHOP OUT ALL OF THE THINGS I DON'T LIKE?"
                            answer="I do use photoshop, but very minimally. I don't like those filters that get rid of all skin texture or edits that make your body unrecognizable. I will get rid of most acne, but I won't smooth out acne scars for example because it would make you look like a totally different person. And I want to highlight your beauty." />
